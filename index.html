                <p>Hi! My name's Ryan, and I'm 28-years old writer and product manager living in the beautiful town of Yardley, Pennsylvania in Bucks County.</p>
                <p>I lived overseas from the age of 3 to 14 in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, and Israel. While living abroad, I spent a good bit of time at the American International School.</p>
                <p>For high school, I followed my big brother's path of attending Phillips Exeter Academy. My big accomplishment during those four years was not quiting and learning to expand my mind with peers.</p>
                <p>Despite being an average high school student at Exeter, I somehow found my way to the US Air Force Academy. I spent four years there and intiially wanted to study Electrical Engineering.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, I took an easier route and studied Economics and delved into the field of Model United Nations. Also, in college, I published my first article (link: )</p>
                <p>Now, I am trying to live a useful life and build useful things for the USAFA alumni community. If you have ideas on what I should build, you can contact me here (link:) !</p>
