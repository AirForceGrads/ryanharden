                <p>Hi! My name's Ryan, and I'm 28-years old living in the beautiful town of Yardley, Pennsylvania in Bucks County. I'm the proud husband of <a href = "https://eminencema.com/staff/emma-nekoroski/">Emma Harden (f/k/a Nekoroski)</a> as of December 2nd, 2022.</p>
                <p>So far, we have 0 children and 1 dog, Piper Harden. Piper is a Bernedoodle mix who was born too short to be a breeding dog, so we got her at a discount. Only when she is terrorizing the house do we fully understand why dogs trade at discounts!</p>
                <p>My graduate degree is from the University of Pennsylvania and is the <a href="https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/">Master of Computer Information Technology</a> and my undergraduate degree is a B.S. in Economics from the US Air Force Academy. While at the Air Force Academy, I spent a lot of time on the Model United Nations team and even wrote an <a href="https://bestdelegate.com/the-u-s-air-force-academy-approach-to-model-united-nations/">article</a> decsribing my experience. Before then, I boarded at Phillips Exeter Academy for the entirety of my high school experience. There, I played lacrosse, wrestled, studied Islam and Christiniaty.</p>
                <p>I have two siblings, an older brother, Tyler, and a younger sister, Waverly. He is a computer scientist and she is a mathematician. We grew up overseas in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, and Israel. While living abroad, we spent a good amount of time at the American International School and really grew to appreciate people, places, and things from all walks of life.</p>                
                <p>Now, I am spending my time at <a href="https://prescientedge.com/">Prescient Edge</a>, building software for the US Navy and Space Force. Ultimately, I want to live a low-stress and useful life by bettering the lives of others.</p>
