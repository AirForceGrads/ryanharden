title: on happiness

I used to think of you as laughter, 

a friend I seldom saw,

and with age, I learned 

of the darkness that you could thaw.


O' even returning despair itself 

from Heaven's almighty brink.

I know you're the grass between toes 

and moonlight dancing by the sink.


Or a friend who shows true concern 

when witnessing my latest fall; 

Akin to a faithful lover 

who helps us overcome all.


So stay with me, happiness! 

And I will stay with you, too.

Inundate me with your senses, 

O' saturate my lacking point of view.
