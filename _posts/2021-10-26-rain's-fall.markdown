title: When rain begins to fall
---
We kissed as lovers, 

before cloud-covered skies.

Expecting eternalness    

while locking our star eyes.


With naked intimacy

we pledged our souls.

Unguarded hearts

released without paroles.


So when you ended us,

you murdered part of me.

Until then, I never knew

love had no guaranty. 


At once, lightning clapped

and thunder boomed. 

Then began rain’s fall

O’ how much too soon.
