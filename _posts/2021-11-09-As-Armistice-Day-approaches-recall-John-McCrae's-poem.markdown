title: As Armistice Day approaches recall John McCrae's poem
---
John McCrae was a Canadian poet, soldier, and physician who served in World War I. During the battle of Belgium's Ypres Salient in April 1915, Mr. McCrae tended to the wounded for almost 17 days.


Within that time, he wrote the famous poem titled: "In Flanders Fields." This poem was an ode to the fallen from the battle and immortalized John McCrae with his symbolic ability to relate the poppy flower to the dead. Grim, but impressive. 


The following lines are attributable to the Poetry Foundation.


In Flanders fields the poppies blow

Between the crosses, row on row,

    That mark our place; and in the sky

    The larks, still bravely singing, fly

Scarce heard amid the guns below.


We are the Dead. Short days ago

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

    Loved and were loved, and now we lie,

        In Flanders fields.


Take up our quarrel with the foe:

To you from failing hands we throw

    The torch; be yours to hold it high.

    If ye break faith with us who die

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

        In Flanders fields.


Thank you!  I hope you enjoyed John McCrae's poem!
