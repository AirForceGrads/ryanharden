I. 

Tavern candles flicker / beyond

silhouette creases / whispering / 

"She's here" / as Nightfall creeps / 

on tip toes / with shoes clutched / 

in Her hands / advancing evermore / 

stealing warmth / from Earthen skin / 

Tender is the Night / unvarnished / 

approaching / unloved / uninvited. 


II.

Beijing-made bikes / pedal rapidly /

rotating / with increased speed /  

home / finding light's / last 

gasps of breathe / minutes left / 

they arrive / home / while drunks 

stumble / into bars / women / 

into stores / searching / like addicts / 

for Serotonin hugs / to refill / 

and replenish / malnourished minds.
