title: Happy Easter!
---

To everyone who has read, supported, and found helpful information on this website, I wish you a Happy Easter! This past weekend, I have been especially lucky to spend time with family and friends as I turned 26 yesterday. I hope everyone is as lucky as I am to spend time with the people they care about.


Since tomorrow is Patriot's Day, I am under the impression that I have the day off (and hopefully will be able to sleep in!). 


However, I hope to share what I've been up to lately. 


First, I am preparing for many, many things. One is that I have to bid on Air Force bases, but I will likely separate unless I can get a desirable assignment to stay in Massachusetts. Another item on my list is preparing my resume for jobs, and lastly, preparing my resume and application for law schools.


That's all for nowâ€”more info on the Air Force Academy, law schools, and veteran transition programs to follow.


Best,

Ryan Harden
