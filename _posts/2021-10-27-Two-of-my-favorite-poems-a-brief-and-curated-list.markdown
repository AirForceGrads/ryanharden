title: Two of my favorite poems, a brief and curated list
---


Hi everyone!  Today I wanted to share with you a curated list of my favorite poems.  It is my intention that this article acts as a living and breathing document.  


Right now, my favorite poem is:

"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain," by Emily Dickinson
Wow.  When I read this poem, I felt chills crawl down my spine.  As many already know, Emily Dickinson is a fantastic poet who loves to employ slant rhymes.  A slant rhyme is a near rhyme (to put it in layman terms).  An example is: 'boom' and 'soon'. Her poem is here! 


Next, another fantastic poem by a lesser-known but equally-excellent poet is:

 "A Proper Burial" by Sean Purio
With only nine stanzas, the poet reflects upon life after death and, importantly, what is considered "A Proper Burial" (to borrow his words).  


In fact, the start of his poem, in which he uses "in lieu of..." was inspirational for another poem that I had written. His poem is here! That concludes the list for now!
