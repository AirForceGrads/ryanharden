<h2>Work History</h2>
<p>Right now, I am a full-time Technical Product Manager at Prescient Edge, and, at night, I rotate my evenings
between helping my father with his company, <a href="https://www.georgetownstrategy.org">The Georgetown Strategy Group</a>, 
or taking computer science graduate classes at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Before, I had spent the majority of my career in the US Air Force as a "63A Program Manager" in defense acquisitions. And,
my first job outside of the military was at McMaster-Carr, an ecommerce industrial supplier, as a Customer Accounts Manager.
While there, I developed two applications that saved 2 FTEs and are still being used to this day.
